# `@idfkit/schemas`

EnergyPlus epJSON schemas for all 17 supported versions, content-addressed so
that the whole set is around 1 MB gzipped rather than 11.9 MB. See
[Content-addressed schemas](../explanation/content-addressed-schemas.md) for why,
and [Slim schema format](slim-schema-format.md) for what a definition contains.

```bash
npm install @idfkit/schemas
```

`@idfkit/core` re-exports `Schema`, `SchemaBundle`, `httpSource`, and the slim
type definitions, so most applications never import this package directly.
